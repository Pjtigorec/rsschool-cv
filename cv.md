## About myself:

Hi)

I'm not really a novice developer, but I want to keep myself in good shape and do what I've been dreaming about for a long time - to establish a new development area for me

I am from Belarus, [Mogilev](https://goo.gl/maps/J5DJFpL4MJ88Cc5fA), but now I live in Poland, [Gdansk](https://goo.gl/maps/rMMqjsssU65g4qbF8).
If suddenly someone wants to visit the city - be sure to contact me and I'll help you with excursion!)

And in general, I also created training in my hometown, so I will be happy to help with any questions I can answer (and can't :D)

Started my career at EPAM in 2018 and finished BRU in 2020, Mogilev. Software engineer degree (ПИР-161)
